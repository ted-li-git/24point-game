# 24 Point Game

## Game Introduction
The 24 Point Game is a classic mathematical puzzle game where the objective is to combine four given numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to form an expression that evaluates to 24. The game not only tests the player's mathematical skills but also enhances logical thinking and quick response abilities.

## Game Rules
1. At the start of the game, the system randomly generates four numbers (the range depends on the difficulty setting).
2. Players must use these four numbers along with the four arithmetic operations (addition [+], subtraction [-], multiplication [*], and division [/]) to construct an expression that results in 24.
3. Each number must be used exactly once, and operators can be reused.
4. If the player successfully constructs an expression that evaluates to 24, they win the game; otherwise, they can try again or restart the game.

## Game Interface
- **Start Screen**: Displays the game title and version information, and provides buttons for "Start Game," "Settings," "About," and "Exit."
- **Game Screen**: Shows the four randomly generated numbers, provides an input box for the player to enter their expression, and includes buttons for "Check Answer," "Restart," "Hint," and "Return to Start Screen."
- **Settings Screen**: Allows players to choose the game difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **About Screen**: Displays the game version and author information.

## Features
- **Check Answer**: Verifies if the player's input expression is correct.
- **Restart**: Generates a new set of four numbers and starts a new round.
- **Hint**: Provides some solution hints or partial expression structures to help the player find the answer.
- **Return to Start Screen**: Exits the current game screen and returns to the start screen.

## Difficulty Settings
- **Easy**: Numbers range from 1 to 9.
- **Medium**: Numbers range from 1 to 15.
